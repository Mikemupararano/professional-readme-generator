# Professional Readme Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)

## Description
In this application, I have written code to automate the generation of a professional README that can be deployed on Github pages. I have used Inquirer.js, JavaScript, and Node.js to automate the process of generating README files for projects. Inquirer.js is a powerful library for creating interactive command-line interfaces in Node.js, making it perfect for prompting users for input to generate a README file dynamically. I have created a command-line application that accepts user input.
